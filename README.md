## 🚀 Current Mission  
Trying to make my code work before the 10th attempt (progress is… debatable).

## 🎨 Design Philosophy  
`border-radius: 50%;` → "Look, I made a circle!"

## 🤖 AI Adventures  
I trained a model once... it still hates me.

## 📉 Git Mastery  
`git commit -m "please work"` — because sometimes, begging helps.
